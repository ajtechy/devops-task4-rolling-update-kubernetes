<h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>
1. Create a job chain of job1 & job2 using build pipeline plugin in Jenkins.<br>

2. Job1 : Pull the Github repo automatically when some developers push repo to Github and perform the following operations as:<br>
	
      a. Create the new image dynamically for the application and copy the application code   into that corresponding docker image<br>
      
      b. Push that image to the docker hub (Public repository)<br>

     ( Github code contain the application code and Dockerfile to create a new image )<br>

5. Job2 ( Should be run on the dynamic slave of Jenkins configured with Kubernetes kubectl command): Launch the application on the top of Kubernetes cluster performing following operations:<br>

      a. If launching first time then create a deployment of the pod using the image created in the previous job. Else if deployment already exists then do rollout of the existing pod making zero downtime for the user.<br>

      b. If Application created first time, then Expose the application. Else donâ€™t expose it.<br>
